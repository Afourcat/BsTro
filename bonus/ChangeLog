Changelog by : alexandre

Name         : postfix calc & eval expr
Date         : October 26 2017
Changelog by : alexandre
Description  :
	we are going on the postfix function and the parsing system of eval
	expr most of time the function is working but sometimes there is a
	unexptected problem that put a lot of time to resolve, we made 80%
	of the postfix but the eval_expr take lot's of time, time that we
	are losing for the bistro.
