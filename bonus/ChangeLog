Description  :
	we lose lot's of time because of the colle of saturday, but we work
	a lot today, I finished the pow function and thomas debug his division
	algo it's working really fast, but We found a memory leak in
	multiplication. vinchenzo work again on the bistro he is adding his
	eval_expr and modifying it for our infinite operator. Thomas his
	writing the number_base system, we are looking for the best way to
	to do it(Where to place it, how to make it quickly, how to make it
	memory cheap etc...).

Name         : mul div mod et postfix !
Date         : October 27 2017
Changelog by : alexandre
Description  :
	Even if the new mario is out i have to focus, today thomas and
	vichenzo end the postfix notation for all the case, it's a little bit
	tricky but it works cleanly. i made the multiplication function it
	work great. But we have to resolve memory errors. we clean the
	repository and update the makfile, and i'm writting the test for mul
	div and modulo.

Name         : postfix calc & eval expr
Date         : October 26 2017
Changelog by : afourcat
Description  :
	we are going on the postfix function and the parsing system of eval
	expr most of time the function is working but sometimes there is a
	unexptected problem that put a lot of time to resolve,
	We judge that 80% of the postfix is done, but in fact, the eval_expr
	take a lot of time, that we can't use to work on the bistro.
	As such, less work is done than normally.

Name         : Makefile structure and evalexpr continuation
Date         : October 25 2017
Changelog by : afourcat vguibert tnicollet
Description  :
	Thomas finished the postfix system, there still room for improvement,
	we hope they'll be done soon.
	We done some units tests for the postfix subsystem.
	Thomas has made wrapper around the infin_add function in order to do the
	infin_sub one, sadly we haven't been able to test it right after.
	Vinchenzo made severals makefiles, done linking them and finished the
	binary tree subsystem. As time of writing, we are making units tests
	for it.
	Alexandre made a stack_void system for the binary tree, as well as
	units tests for them.
	He also finalized the infin_add subsystem and started the infin_mul
	subsystem, judging it pretty close to be done.
